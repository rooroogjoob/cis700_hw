"The Tale of DespeRATSO" By Andrew Martin
RATSO is a rat who is overwhelmed with life. Everyday is very hard for him so he
tries to take it one moment at a time and take care of himself. Ratso's main goal
is to get to the surface to begin his day. Along the way, he encounters a few
problems including packing a lunch, relaxing, a small maze, and bright lights on
his sensitive eyes.

I picked the topic based on the AI Dungeon II adventure I wrote about for my
in class activity where there was a rat person named Ratso. I really liked the
name and thought an adventure about a rat could offer good excuses to have mazes,
a few references to Ratatouille, and honestly lots of things can be made funny
through this lens. I really liked the idea of having the challenges
of the story be the preparation for the "real" adventure and thought there could
be a good message about how taking care of oneself is an often overlooked but
important part of life. Thus, where most games would begin is where mine ends.
